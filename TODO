- Hack around the "replies to a message" problem by using http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?lang=en&q=@palfrey&rpp=100 (replacing palfrey with username)
- Handle threaded replies? e.g. http://palfrey.livejournal.com/209681.html and the extra replies not being added
- Actually document the bloody thing
